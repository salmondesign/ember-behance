<h2 class="banner">About me</h2>

<p>I'm Rachel. I'm an English graphic designer currently relocating to Reykjavik, Iceland. I studied graphic design at Shillington College in London. I love Italian food and culture, (proper) Cornish pasties and Motown.</p>

<p>I'm currently looking for a full time studio position in Reykjavik but am still enjoying freelance projects around this.</p>
